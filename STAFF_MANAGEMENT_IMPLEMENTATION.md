# Staff Management System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive staff management system for the System Admin role in MediVault. The System Admin can manage different types of staff members within their own registered institute.

## Key Design Decision
**Institute-Specific Management**: Since each System Admin is associated with a specific institute when they register, they can only add and manage staff within their own institute. This eliminates the need for institute selection and ensures data security and proper access control.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ManageStaff Component
- **Location**: `src/components/SystemAdmin/ManageStaff.js`
- **Features**:
  - Staff listing filtered to show only admin's institute staff
  - Search and filter functionality (by name, email, and role)
  - Pagination for large datasets
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Status management (Active/Inactive)
  - Action messages for user feedback
  - Institute-specific staff display

### 2. Role-Specific Staff Forms

  - Navigation between role selection and forms
  - Responsive design with different color schemes for each role
  - Institute auto-assignment (no selection needed)

### 4. Enhanced Modal Component
- **Location**: `src/components/Common/Modal.js`
- **Enhancement**: Added size prop support (sm, md, lg, xl, 4xl)
- **Usage**: Supports different modal sizes for various use cases

## Security & Access Control

### Institute-Specific Access
- **Automatic Institute Assignment**: Staff members are automatically assigned to the logged-in admin's institute
- **Filtered Data Display**: Only staff from the admin's institute are shown in the management interface
- **No Cross-Institute Access**: Admins cannot view or manage staff from other institutes

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState) for local state management
- Form data is structured per role with comprehensive validation
- Error handling with real-time validation feedback

### UI/UX Design
- **Color Coding**:
  - Doctors: Teal theme
  - Nurses: Orange theme
  - Lab Technicians: Blue theme
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper form labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

### Data Structure
Each staff member has the following structure:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  institute: string,
  department: string,
  role: 'doctor' | 'nurse' | 'lab',
  status: 'active' | 'inactive',
  joinDate: string,
  licenseNumber: string,
  // Role-specific fields...
}
```

### Form Validation
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Phone number validation
- Real-time error feedback
- Prevents form submission with invalid data
